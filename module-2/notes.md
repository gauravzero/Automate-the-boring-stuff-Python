# FlowCharts

Flow control statements are instructions that decide which instructions to execute upon which conditions

Boolean Values, Comparison Ops, Boolean Operators

Expressions with Comparison Ops evaluate to Boolean Values

Ex. Expression : 43 > 43.1 -> evaluates to True

Integers an Strings cant be expected to be equal when compared to eachother -- those wont be the same

== -> Comparison
=  -> Assignment

Boolean Operations - AND, OR, NOT

Truth Tables evaluate to every possible value for the operators

Like not truth table will have not true and not false

New blocks only start after a : (colon)
