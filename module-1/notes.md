# Module 1

Expressions are the most basic type of programming instructions in python. They consist of values and operators.

Always reduce to a single value

A single value is also an expressions

All values have a data type. And all values belong to one data type. Text data type values are strings.


Variables are like boxes that store a single value with an assignment statement.

Variables can replace the values in expressions. They simply are replaced and evaluated as the value.

Statements dont evaluate to a single value. However statements could have expressions that evaluate to a single value
